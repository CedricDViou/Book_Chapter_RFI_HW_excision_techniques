\subsubsection{Analog: GMRT (Kaushal)}

Strong narrowband RFI from various sources that affect the upgraded GMRT receiver’s dynamic range and linearity are mitigated using band reject/notch filters. These are incorporated in the front end of the receiver system to ensure that the system operates in the linear region by rejecting strong and persistent RFI from strong short-range transmissions, mobile communication, and broadcast television \cite{sureshkumar2016rfi}. Efforts to use the latest techniques to have the filter before the LNA are being developed to avoid saturation due to strong interfering signals.

\subsubsection{Digital: Excision in time}

\begin{itemize}
\item MAD filter GMRT (Kaushal)

The upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) \cite{gupta2017upgraded} operates from 120 to 1450 MHz and has near-seamless coverage in this band. It is an array of 30, 45m diameter parabolic dishes and a sensitive receiver which operates in the interferometry and beamformer modes. The array is located 80 km north of Pune in India. The increase in the population around the array in the last 30 years along with the proliferation of communication devices, satellites, and mobile phones, has caused an increase in the RFI. The uGMRT signal processing backend has a real-time RFI excision system for mitigating RFI and achieving sensitivity levels close to the theoretical limits. \\

\begin{figure}

    \caption{A 50ms time-series of single antenna Band-4 (550-850 MHz) data. Powerline RFI can be seen to occur in bunches repeating every 10ms. The data is acquired at the input of the signal processing system with a time resolution of 5ns.}
    \label{fig:ugmrt-b4-ts}
\end{figure}

One of the main causes of RFI at frequencies less than 1 GHz is sparking and corona discharge on the high-tension lines and transformer installations around the array. This type of RFI is impulsive in the time domain (Ref. Figure~\ref{fig:ugmrt-b4-ts} resulting in a broadband increase in the power in the spectral domain. Since this type of RFI cannot be mitigated by frequency selective filters in the receiver system, a real-time statistical RFI excision system was developed which operates on digitized time-series from each antenna and polarization. This system is designed to excise strong impulses in the received signal. \\

The real-time system currently implemented on FPGA \cite{buch2019real} uses a median-based robust estimation and threshold detection scheme. Each incoming sample (at Nyquist rate) is compared with a robust threshold and samples detected as RFI are replaced with a constant value, threshold or digital noise sample. After rigorous testing on various astronomical data products, the RFI system is released for observations and is currently extensively used for observations in the lower frequency bands of uGMRT (< 1GHz). An example of imaging through this system wherein half the antennas used the original signal whereas the other half used the filtered copy \cite{buch2022performance} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ugmrt-b4-image}. \\

\end{figure}

A possibility of refinements to the technique including mitigating low-level RFI, using learning-based approaches, and implementing similar techniques in real-time for mitigating narrowband RFI \cite{buch2016real} is being looked at. The technique is also being proposed \cite{buch2023real}for upcoming telescope like the SKA.\\


\item post-PFB (LWA+DSA-2000 - Greg)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Digital: Excision in spectral}
\begin{itemize}
\item AOFlagger-type Westerbork (Greg)

 RFIm \cite{sclocco2019real} is an open-source, high-performance library designed to mitigate RFI in real time. RFIm is optimized to run on many-core accelerators such as GPUs and provides methods that are robust yet computationally efficient. The library features two main algorithms: Time-Domain Sigma Cut (TDSC) and Frequency-Domain Sigma Cut (FDSC). These two algorithms detect and replace RFI-contaminated data with statistical averages to reduce false positives without significant impact on processing time. This approach allows systems like the Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS) to maintain high data throughput while effectively identifying real astronomical signals amidst increasing anthropogenic and satellite-generated interference.
 
\item Higher-order statistics at EOVSA (Greg)

The Spectral Kurtosis (SK) technique is a statistical method used for real-time detection of non-Gaussian signals, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), within Gaussian noise in radio astronomy data. The SK estimator distinguishes signals by comparing power and power-squared values of spectral data to detect deviations from Gaussian behaviour. The Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) implements this SK technique in its correlator, using an FPGA-based system to perform real-time SK calculations directly within the Fourier transform engine \cite{}. This design allows the system to flag and exclude contaminated data dynamically, enhancing the quality of observations by effectively identifying and mitigating RFI while preserving genuine astronomical signals.

\item MeFisTo: Frequency and Time Median filter on Nançay Decameter Array (Cedric)

Between 5 and 88 MHz, the lowest part of the frequency band accessible to ground-based telescopes, the sky is crowded with audio and timing broadcast users, allocated to frequency channels much closer than the frequency resolution required to meet the scientific needs of solar and Jovian observations. This band is also affected by wideband RFI generated by electric fences, spark ignition systems from internal combustion engines, and power lines.

Time and frequency analysis of this band must be performed with temporal and spectral resolutions far exceeding the requirements for scientific observations. This results in data streams and data sets much larger than necessary for scientific purposes.

Since 2013, a receiver \cite{lecacheux2013, 2017pre8.conf..455L} based on 80-MSps ADCs and a Stratix IV FPGA has implemented a real-time streaming Blackman-Harris-windowed 64k-FFT, followed by classical (averaged) time-frequency analysis using a Welch-averaged periodogram. Simultaneously, the same periodogram is computed with a median filter (kernel size=64) applied first on the frequency axis, then on the time axis (kernel size=128), to mitigate narrowband and wideband RFI in observations. The frequency resolution for RFI mitigation is as low as 1.2 kHz, but it is raised to 78 kHz for scientific purposes. The time resolution for RFI mitigation is 0.8 ms but is increased to 104 ms to provide a sustainable data rate for 24/7 monitoring of the Sun and Jupiter.

\end{figure}


\item RFI mitigation implementations on RDH at Nançay (Cedric)

In the early 20th century, a configurable digital receiver was deployed at the Nançay Observatory. The receiver's ADC+FPGA+DSP system was shared by the 100-meter Decimeter Wavelength Telescope (NRT) and the Decameter Wavelength Analog Phased-Array (NDA). The main purpose of this receiver was to develop operational techniques for RFI mitigation. This hardware is now largely obsolete and was decommissioned years ago. However, the techniques remain and may be reused in future deployments.

The core work in designing these operational RFI mitigation techniques relies on a detailed study of the statistical behavior of operators that can be easily implemented in real-time digital logic to create robust mean power estimators \cite{dumezviou:tel-00319939}. This toolbox can then be used to develop custom implementations that address the challenges encountered in the design of digital receivers for radioastronomy.  Next, two implementations are presented:

\begin{itemize}
\item HI red-shifted radio galaxies have the rest frequency of the hyperfine transition at 1420 MHz shifted into frequency bands allocated to L-band radar systems used for civil and military aircraft detection and ranging. Every 5 or 10 MHz, a radar system emits several kilowatts of power for one microsecond, with a pulse rate period of one millisecond. Theoretically, the sky is clear during the remaining 999 microseconds and available for astronomical observations. Detecting strong radar pulses with SNRs tens of dB above system noise is straightforward. The challenge lies in detecting weak pulses with negative-dB SNRs while maintaining an acceptable false alarm rate.

This was successfully implemented in the very limited ressources of Virtex II FPGAs using the previously mentioned toolbox, allowing the excision of data blocks contaminated by both weak and strong radar pulses before they are passed to the spectral analysis block. As a result, HI surveys can now be conducted without artifacts originating from radar systems.


\item Red-shifted OH mega-masers may have their 1665 and 1667 MHz lines fall into the band used by the Iridium satellite constellation. This system manages access to the radio spectrum through a TFDMA scheme. During the test campaign, only a few percent of the millisecond-scale instantaneous spectrum was occupied, but after a few seconds of time integration, the entire band became corrupted.

Spectral analysis was configured to generate data with time and frequency resolutions (3.4 kHz and 2.34 ms) tailored to the TFDMA characteristics. A MAD-estimated power criterion was then applied to discriminate between corrupted and pristine data slots, allowing RFI to be removed from the dataset before integration.

    \caption{Re-observation of III Zw 35 on January 8, 2004, in real-time after 14 minutes of integration with the NRT: (a) Without "blanking." The vertical axis is adjusted to make the expected source profile visible. (b) With "blanking" (3.5\% of data eliminated). The source is clearly visible again.}
    \label{fig:rfi_Iridium_blanked}
\end{figure}

This was implemented on TMS 6203 TI DSP chips to process the frequency band in real-time.
\end{itemize}


\item CHIME (Thushara): The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a radio telescope primarily designed to study the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas in the Universe. Serendipitously, it turned out to be an excellent instrument for detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs), the mysterious millisecond-long radio flashes of unknown origin. When processed with the CHIME FRB pipeline, strong impulsive RFI may lead to false positives and therefore needs to be mitigated. Several real-time iterative processes have been applied iteratively to weed out the statistical outliers from the channelized intensity data that are effectively high-pass filtered.



\item MeerKAT: correlator dumps outlier excision at high time res (ingest step, see Sihlangu and Ludwig)
The ingest stage directly after the MeerKAT correlator has a fast and simple “1-D” mean absolute deviation (MAD) filter (“ingest\_rfi”) which identifies the background by running along the frequency axis and thresholds each dump and correlation product independently. It runs on a GPU and is conservatively tuned to identify obvious spikes in amplitude, flagging roughly 4\% of the data in the L band. This applies to all imaging modes but not pulsar mode, which has its own RFI mitigation scheme.
Initially, the ingest stage also excised data that was flagged by the “ingest\_rfi” filter before it averaged 0.5-second raw correlator dumps to the final 8-second dumps. Scientists did not like this idea (and RFI researchers even more so!), so it was canned.

The majority keep the more conservative “ingest\_rfi” flags but not the more aggressive “cal\_rfi” flags. Observers that take our pipeline images will have all flags applied.

The main codebase for our flagger is https://github.com/ska-sa/katsdpsigproc. The tricolour MeerKAT flagger is a similar standalone flagging package. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09179.


\item MeerKAT: calibration step VarThreshold  (see Sihlangu and Ludwig)
The calibration pipeline which follows after ingest has a more advanced “2-D” flagger (“cal\_rfi”). It is a tweaked AOFlagger written from scratch in Numba. It identifies the background by running along both the time and frequency axes. It performs two passes, first finding a smooth background on previously unflagged parts and then sum-thresholding. It only flags HV and VH (cross-hand) data and extends the results to HH and VV. It flags the calibrator before solving for gains, and it flags the target after applying gain corrections to it, which allows more stringent flagger parameters. It typically flags about 20\% of the data in the L band. This applies to all imaging modes but not pulsar mode, which has its own RFI mitigation scheme.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prospective real-time implementations}
\label{subsection:hardware:catalog:prospective}

\subsubsection{Preventive: Dynamic scheduler (Greg)}
\subsubsection{Preventive: satellite avoidance at Green Bank}
Satellite boresight avoidance is a technique to prevent satellites from directly illuminating a telescope's primary observation direction. In experiments conducted by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) with Starlink satellites, this technique was tested \cite{nhan2024spectrumcoexistencedemonstrationeffectiveness} by adjusting the satellite constellation's configuration based on real-time telescope pointing data and predicted satellite trajectories. This approach minimizes interference by dynamically coordinating telescope operations with satellite activities, such as emission control and beam steering. The process is facilitated by the Operational Data Sharing (ODS) system, an autonomous platform developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). ODS provides satellite operators with real-time updates on telescope positions and observing frequencies, allowing them to adjust satellite operations accordingly. With frequent updates, potentially every minute, ODS ensures effective coordination, especially during close satellite passes near the telescope’s boresight

%\subsubsection{Analog: Notch filters for uGMRT (Kaushal)}
\subsubsection{Analog : Tunable notch filter DSA-2000 (Greg)}

The tunable notch filters are designed to mitigate RFI in the analog front end of the DSA-2000 receivers. The Quad-Stub Resonator Filter uses four high-Q “series LC” stubs, each controlled by voltage-tuned varactors, allowing independent frequency tuning for precise RFI mitigation. The filter achieves deep notch attenuation, adjustable within a range of 550 MHz to 1050 MHz, with peak attenuation up to 62.5 dB. It features a chassis design with RFI-tight seals and SMA connectors to prevent interference coupling. The filter's response is fine-tuned through individual varactor bias adjustments, enabling adaptable and effective RFI suppression across a broad frequency range.

\subsubsection{Analog: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (Greg)}

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can mitigate RFI at the telescope receiver by dynamically shaping the electromagnetic wavefronts to create a destructive interference zone around the receiver \cite{zou2022scisrs,wei2024ris,wei2023multistage}. The RIS array, composed of multiple controllable elements, adjusts the phase and amplitude of reflected signals to precisely counteract incoming RFI. By steering reflected signals from the RIS in such a way that they are out of phase with the incident RFI, the RIS effectively cancels the RFI energy before it reaches the telescope’s receiver. This approach allows for the creation of an electromagnetic quiet zone, enabling the telescope to perform sensitive astronomical observations without interference from external RFI sources, such as aircraft and satellites, without altering the telescope’s primary astronomical signals.

\subsubsection{Digital: SK EDD Effelserg}
\subsubsection{Digital: cyclic spectroscopy Green Bank}

\subsubsection{Digital: Excision in time parametric subtraction Ellingson (Greg)}

The time-domain coherent cancellation (CTC) technique is a method used to mitigate RFI by subtracting an interference estimate from the received signal in real-time \cite{ellingson2022coherent}. CTC operates by generating a reference signal that represents the interfering source, which can be acquired externally (e.g., through a separate antenna) or synthesized internally using prior knowledge of the interference. The reference signal is used to create an interference estimate that is coherently subtracted from the received signal, ideally leaving only the astronomical signal of interest with minimal added noise or distortion. The approach allows telescopes to "look through" interference, preserving affected data that would otherwise be discarded by traditional methods, though it requires precise estimation and synchronization to avoid errors that could compromise the scientific data.

\subsubsection{Digital: Threshold-based pre-correlation RFI detection technique to be used in SKA.Mid (Thushara)}
\label{subsection:hardware:catalog:ska-mid}

The Correlator Beamformer for the Mid-frequency telescope for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Mid. CBF) uses a 'power threshold-based' RFI detection scheme. The main objective is to preserve the linearity of the signal chain while achieving the desired dynamic range to maintain the sensitivity. The architecture of the proposed RFI detector/flagger module is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rfi_df_ska_mid_cbf}. As shown there, two-time scales are involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Long-term ($>$1 sec, considering on/off state of the noise diode) for establishing an average power level, and
    \item Short-term to detect and flag bursting RFI to prevent downstream spectral splatter.
\end{enumerate}

The number of samples used for the short-term power calculation is programmable. If the short-term power calculation is greater than a programmable threshold, set by the Telescope-Manage or internally determined if “auto-set”, then a flag is set and carried with the data stream to the downstream processing module, and downstream operations (i.e. any that affect output data products or intermediate calculations needed such as gains/levels settings) are inhibited for the number of samples that it takes the flag to propagate through all downstream processing modules. As per the flagging policy, both polarization components are flagged if one is flagged. The dwell time of the flag is also programmable to balance the data loss with the risk of contamination. Note that the flagged data is not used in evaluating the long-term power calculation to have an estimate of the signal level of the non-RFI-contaminated signal. The long-term power is accumulated in two separate bins, one for noise diode on, and one for noise diode off.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Digital: excision in UV domain (Greg)}

GRIDflag \cite{10464448} is a UV-plane-based RFI flagging algorithm designed to enhance the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of radio interferometric observations in the presence of strong and persistent RFI. Unlike traditional methods that flag RFI in the time-channel plane of baselines, GRIDflag operates directly in the UV plane, where multiple baselines sample similar spatial Fourier components redundantly across a regular grid. By statistically comparing UV samples within each grid pixel, GRIDflag identifies and flags RFI-affected points, preserving UV coverage and sensitivity to spatial scales. This approach is particularly effective in mitigating systematic noise introduced by faint RFI, which can otherwise degrade image sensitivity and accuracy. GRIDflag's design allows it to be computationally efficient and adaptable to modern technologies like GPUs, making it well-suited for current and next-generation radio telescopes.

\subsubsection{Digital: Spatial filtering (Greg, Kaushal)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic spatial filtering

The core idea is to leverage the spatial diversity of RFI and astronomical signals, along with the unique spatial signatures of interfering sources, to separate and suppress RFI \cite{hellbourg2014radio,hellbourg2016spatial,hellbourg2014rfi}. By estimating the RFI subspace using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and exploiting cyclostationary properties of RFI signals, spatial filters are designed to project received signals onto subspaces orthogonal to the RFI, effectively nulling interference. These filters can be applied either before or after correlation stages in the data processing chain. The technique is particularly valuable for modern radio telescopes, such as LOFAR and EMBRACE, where dense antenna arrays provide numerous redundant measurements, enhancing the precision of RFI mitigation without significantly impacting the desired astronomical signal. This approach helps maintain high fidelity and sensitivity in observations despite increasing RFI challenges from human-made sources.

\item Reference-antenna

A reference antenna can be used to mitigate RFI in real-time by providing an accurate estimation of the RFI spatial signature, which can then be used for spatial filtering in radio astronomy. The reference antenna is positioned to specifically capture the RFI without significantly receiving the astronomical signals. This RFI reference signal is correlated with the signals received by the main telescope array, allowing the RFI's spatial signature to be extracted and identified. This information is then used to project out the RFI from the main array's data using spatial filtering techniques, such as subspace projection.

By continuously updating the RFI spatial signature using subspace tracking algorithms, like the Power Method or Rayleigh Quotient Iteration, the system can adapt to changes in the RFI environment in real-time, effectively cancelling out the interference without impacting the astronomical signals. This approach is particularly effective for managing multiple RFI sources and dynamically changing interference patterns, enabling high-fidelity observations even in heavily contaminated radio bands\cite{hellbourg2014reference,sardarabadi2015spatial}.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Digital AI/ML} (Greg, Kaushal)
\begin{itemize}
\item Collaborative Signal Subtraction (Greg)

The collaborative approach to RFI mitigation works by establishing a bidirectional communication between radio telescopes and interfering sources, such as cellular networks, to actively share RFI information and cancel interference in real-time. The interfering sources decompose their signals into a compact representation using techniques like the Karhunen–Loève Transform (KLT), which captures the signal's statistical properties independent of time and frequency. This RFI information, including eigenfunctions representing the interference, is periodically shared with the telescope through a low-overhead communication channel.

At the telescope, the received composite signal, which includes both astronomical signals and RFI, is similarly decomposed. The shared RFI characteristics are then used to cancel the interference from the telescope’s data through orthogonal projections in the eigenspace, thereby revealing clean astronomical signals. This approach significantly reduces communication and computational overhead by prioritizing the sharing of high-impact RFI data and selectively updating the interference model based on its influence on the telescope, thus maintaining high accuracy in signal recovery while managing multiple RFI sources effectively \cite{chakraborty2023collaboration,chakraborty2024low}.

\item Pattern recognition (Greg)

Automated pattern recognition to identify RFI in real-time radio astronomy data \cite{Winkel_2007} uses edge detection and window fitting to isolate high-intensity regions in the time-frequency domain, likely corresponding to RFI. Statistical analysis then helps differentiate RFI from genuine astronomical signals by comparing intensity patterns and variations. Iterative baseline fitting further refines the detection to ensure that RFI is accurately identified without impacting the integrity of the astronomical data. This method can be implemented in real-time systems, enabling dynamic flagging and mitigation of RFI, which is crucial for maintaining data quality in environments prone to interference, such as those near populated areas or satellite systems.

\item External flag generation (RFI monitor?) (Greg)

An RFI detector can provide real-time flags for radio telescopes by using machine learning techniques to automatically identify and classify interference in the radio frequency spectrum. The system described here \cite{9111666} employs a deep neural network (DNN) that processes time-frequency data, detecting and drawing bounding boxes around RFI events. This approach allows the detector to continuously monitor the RF environment and flag novel or anomalous RFI events in real time. The detected RFI events are flagged based on their spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics, allowing the telescope to dynamically adjust its data processing pipeline to exclude or compensate for contaminated signals.

By integrating with the telescope’s data stream, the system can provide immediate notifications about RFI, enabling telescopes to respond promptly to interference without manual intervention. This real-time detection capability is particularly useful for maintaining the quality of astronomical observations by preventing the degradation of data due to unwanted interference.

\item Real-time RFI Prediction for Satellite RFI at GMRT

For spatially confined sources of interference that affect the GMRT for a fraction of the observing time when the beam of the telescope cuts the beam of the satellites, a real-time satellite monitoring system has been implemented. This system informs the user ahead of time about the satellite passes, and typical duration, logs the data, and raises an alarm in the control room \cite{raybole2016real}.



%\item Use of higher order statistics (Kaushal)
\end{itemize}
