\begin{itemize}
\item AOFlagger-type Westerbork (Greg)
\item Higher-order statistics at EOVSA (Greg)

\item Frequency and Time Median filter on Nancay Decameter Array (Cedric)

Will describe here a receiver that operates in the 10-35 MHz band for solar and Jovian daily observations since 2015 (?).

It implements a classical (averaged-based) time-frequency analysis using a Welch averaged periodogram and simultaneously computes the same periodogram with a median filter applied on the frequency axis first and then on the time axis to mitigate narrow-band and wide-band RFI from observations.

\item RFI mitigation implementations on RDH at Nançay (Cedric)

Will describe here :
\begin{itemize}
\item a time domain impulse detector based on a power criterion to mitigate L-band radar system radio echoes with excision of time domain data.  Such RFI is used to impair observations of red-shifted HI galaxies observed at the Nançay Decimeter Radiotelescope.
\item a time-frequency domain based on a MAD-estimated power criterion to mitigate Iridium constellation space-to-earth downlinks.  Such RFI was used to impair observations of 1667-MHz red-shifted OH line from mega-maser that would fall near 1622\ MHz.
\end{itemize}


\item CHIME (Thushara)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prospective real-time implementations}

\subsubsection{Analog : Tunable notch filter DSA-2000 (Greg)}
\subsubsection{Analog : Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (Greg)}
\subsubsection{Digital : Excision in time parametric subtraction ellingson (Greg)}

\subsubsection{Digital : Threshold-based pre-correlation RFI detection technique to be used in SKA.Mid (Thushara)}
\label{subsection:hardware:catalog:ska-mid}

The Correlator Beamformer for the Mid-frequency telescope for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Mid.CBF) is to use 'power threshold-based' RFI detection scheme. The threshold is set according to the policy that dynamically balance loss of data with the cost of extenmding the linearity of the signal chain of the Mid.CBF.  

\subsubsection{Digital : excision in UV domain (Greg)}
\subsubsection{Digital : Spatial filtering (Greg, Kaushal)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic spatial filtering
\item Reference-antenna
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Digital AI/ML} (Greg, Kaushal)
\begin{itemize}
\item signal subtraction (Greg)
\item Pattern recognition (Greg)
\item External flag generation (RFI monitor?) (Greg)
\item Use of higher order statistics (Kaushal)
\end{itemize}
